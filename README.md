# AllWays-Care-Smart-Watch

**AllWays-Care** is an automated background-running health and safety system designed for elderly users living alone. By monitoring real-time health signals and motion data, the system removes the burden of manual operation—there is no button to press and no app to open. The system *acts automatically* when danger is detected.

##  Key Features

* **Continuous Background Monitoring:** Captures heart rate (HR), sleep quality, and activity levels without user intervention.
* **Automatic Anomaly Detection:** Identifies falls, sudden inactivity, or irregular heart rates using real-time sensor data.
* **Zero-Interaction Alerts:** If danger is detected, the system instantly alerts caregivers and emergency contacts.
* **Live Location Sharing:** Emergency alerts include real-time GPS coordinates for immediate response.
* **Automatic Sync:** Data captures on the smartwatch are instantly synced to the smartphone system for processing and alerting.

##  How It Works

1.  **Passive Sensing:** The watch captures real-time signals (HR, activity, fall-risk indicators) in the background.
2.  **Edge Analysis:** The system analyzes the data for anomalies like sudden impacts followed by inactivity.
3.  **Instant Notification:** Upon detection of a potential emergency, a high-priority alert is sent to pre-configured emergency contacts with the user's live location.
